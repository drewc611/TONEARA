## Summary for this repository

No findings above Info.

Automated passes run against this repository: gitleaks 8.24.2 (full history and tree), the placeholder-credential checker now shipped in `scripts/`, semgrep 1.178.0 (`p/security-audit`, `p/secrets`, `p/owasp-top-ten`, `p/github-actions`), bandit, pip-audit and npm audit where applicable, plus a manual review of auth, input handling, workflows and deployment files.

## Findings

| ID | Severity | Category | Location | Evidence | Impact | Fix | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| TN-1 | Info | Reference implementation | `.github/workflows/*.yml; app/index.html:22` | Every action SHA-pinned with version comment; `permissions: contents: read` everywhere; `persist-credentials: false`; strict CSP; zero runtime dependencies | None. This repo is the model the guardrails copy. | Keep as is. | open |

## Guardrails added in this change

- `scripts/check-placeholder-secrets.sh` — fails the build on placeholder credentials, secret defaults, disabled-auth defaults, `debug=True`, literal secret assignments, private keys and committed `.env` files.
- `.gitleaks.toml` — gitleaks defaults plus custom placeholder rules and a fixture allowlist.
- `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` — runs both on every push and pull request and weekly over full history (SHA-pinned actions).
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` — the same checks locally; run `pre-commit install` once.
- `docs/security/AI-CODING-GUARDRAILS.md` — the binding rules for any AI-assisted change, with references.
- A "Security rules for AI-assisted changes" section in `CLAUDE.md` (and `AGENTS.md` / Copilot instructions where present).
- `.gitignore` rules for `.env`, keys and Terraform state where they were missing.

See the cross-repository report for the fail-closed pattern by language and the prioritised fix list.
